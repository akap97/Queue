# Queue

#### 1) The first line of the input contains the size S of the buffer and the number n of incoming network packets. Each of the next n lines contains two numbers. i-th line contains the time of arrival Ai and the processing time Pi (both in milliseconds) of the i-th packet. It is guaranteed that the sequence of arrival times is non-decreasing (however, it can contain the exact same times of arrival in milliseconds â€” in this case the packet which is earlier in the input is considered to have arrived earlier).
