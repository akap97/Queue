# Queue

#### 1) process_packets: The first line of the input contains the size S of the buffer and the number n of incoming network packets. Each of the next n lines contains two numbers. i-th line contains the time of arrival Ai and the processing time Pi (both in milliseconds) of the i-th packet. It is guaranteed that the sequence of arrival times is non-decreasing (however, it can contain the exact same times of arrival in milliseconds — in this case the packet which is earlier in the input is considered to have arrived earlier). For each packet output either the moment of time (in milliseconds) when the processor began processing it or −1 if the packet was dropped (output the answers for the packets in the same order as the packets are given in the input).

#### 2) FirstNegativeEveryWindow: Given an array and a positive integer k, find the first negative integer for each and every window(contiguous subarray) of size k.
